      <strong>Step 1:</strong> Make the Burger Patties: Heat a grill pan or
      sautÃ© pan over medium heat. As it heats, combine ground beef, Old Bay,
      pepper and salt. Form into four equally sized patties, about 1/3 lb
      apiece. Set on a platter next to the stovetop. Coat the warmed grill pan
      with cooking spray and place patties on the pan, cooking each side about
      4-5 minutes, or until cooked through to your desired doneness.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Step 2:</strong> Use a large star-shaped cookie cutter to cut each
      cheese slice into a star shape. Place the star-shaped cheese on each
      burger patty, in the last 30 seconds or so of cooking, so it melts a
      little. Set burger patties aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Step 3:</strong> Make King Neptuneâ€™s Poseidon Powder Aioli: Stir
      mayo and Old Bay until thoroughly combined.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Step 4:</strong> Assemble the Sandwich: Spread Poseidon Powder
      Aioli on the bottom of each bun. Top with a burger patty, ketchup,
      mustard, pickles, onion slices, tomato and lettuce. Place the top bun on
      each burger. Serve.

    <p><strong>Step 1:</strong>Preheat the oven to 350Â°F (180Â°C).</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Step 2:</strong>Make the tortilla shells: Cut each tortilla into a
      6-inch square. Place a 3-inch metal ring, such as a cookie cutter, at the
      center of a tortilla and fold up the ends on either side of the ring
      opening, then clamp together with a small paper clip. Place the tortilla
      in a medium metal bowl so the unclamped ends fold up along the sides of
      the bowl. Transfer the bowl with the tortilla to the oven and bake for 5
      minutes, until lightly browned and crunchy. Remove from the oven and let
      cool until safe to handle, then remove the paper clip and ring. Repeat
      with the remaining tortilla squares.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Step 3:</strong>Make the meat filling: Heat the canola oil in a
      large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the onion and cook until lightly
      browned, about 4 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute, until
      fragrant. Add the ground beef and cook until the meat is browned and
      cooked through, about 4 minutes. Drain any excess liquid from the pan.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Step 4:</strong>Add the ancho chile powder, cumin, coriander,
      paprika, black pepper, cornstarch, salt, and orange zest and stir to
      combine, then use a whisk to mash the beef in the pan to break up any
      large pieces. Remove the pan from the heat and set aside until ready to
      assemble the nacos.
    </p>
      <p>
      <strong>Step 5:</strong>Make the cheese sauce: Dice the cheese into 1-inch cubes, then add to a medium saucepan with the diced tomatoes and water. Warm over low heat until the cheese cubes have fully melted and the tomatoes are incorporated, about 5 minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Step 6:</strong>Assemble the nacos: Add Â¼ cup of tortilla chips to a naco shell, followed by Â½ cup of the meat filling, Â¼ cup shredded lettuce, 2 tablespoons guacamole, 2 tablespoons diced tomatoes, 2 tablespoons pickled jalapeÃ±os, 1 tablespoon sour cream, and Â¼ cup cheese sauce. Repeat with the remaining ingredients to make 4 nacos total.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Step 7:</strong>ENJOY!
